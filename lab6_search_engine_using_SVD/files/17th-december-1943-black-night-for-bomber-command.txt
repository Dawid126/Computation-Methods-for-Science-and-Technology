On the night of the 16th/17th December Bomber Command went back to Berlin yet again. Most of the bombing hit housing and railways rather than industrial sites. Over 700 people were killed, although German records were no longer as accurate as they had been. As many as 279 of those killed were foreign workers, including over 70 when a train received a direct hit. By now around a quarter of housing in Berlin was uninhabitable. Damage to the railways was now starting to cause serious delays to munitions traffic for the Eastern front.25 Lancasters were lost to fighters and anti aircraft fire over Germany. Worse was to come as the bombers returned to England in the early hours of the 17th to find that many of their airfields were fog bound. The situation became desperate at the planes began to run out of fuel. Some crews abandoned their aircraft and baled out. More died when their planes crashed on landing. In total 29 planes were lost and 148 men killed. It was the worse single night for such ‘accidental’ losses. No 97 Squadron RAF was the worst hit. Three of their aircraft managed to find Gravely where FIDO –  a system for burning off the fog and lighting the runway using large quantities of burning petrol, sprayed from pipes beside the runway – was in operation. For others time ran out too quickly:The story of 97 Squadron was originally available at http://www.firebynight.co.uk/website%20menu.html – FirebyNight.It may be possible to access this from the internet archive.16.12.43        21 aircraft detailed to attack Berlin.
