Behind these I could discern a back cloth of reddish haze as buildings began to blaze.“…too scared to go to bed. In the flicks [cinema] when it started…Water and gas off. I feel shaken and worn out for lack of sleep.”Swansea.
On each night the concentration of bombing was on the centre of the town and adjacent working-class districts. The result was extensive damage to business premises and private houses, but comparatively little to industry. The most serious effect on production was caused by the dislocation of utility services, all of which were affected.The railways were seriously disorganised. Traffic on the main G.W.R. line was suspended, High Street Station was closed and the L.M.S. line was blocked at Mumbles Road. The situation was eased by diversion and the use of buses. Only four key points were hit; in all cases damage was slight, except in the docks where a shed containing degaussing equipment was destroyed by fire.Casualties. For the week ending 0600 hours, the 26th February, casualties are estimated to have been 284 people killed and 433 injured, of which 200 were killed and 254 injured at Swansea. 20th february 1941 more heavy bombing of swansea
