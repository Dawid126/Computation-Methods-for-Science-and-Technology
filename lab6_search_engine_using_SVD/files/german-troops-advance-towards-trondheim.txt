The British had now decided to evacuate central Norway. A narrow single track road and single line railway ran from their front line near Dombaas to the the port at Aandalsnes and there was only limited transport available for the exhausted troops. Aandalsnes itself was being continuously bombed  and stores and equipment stockpiled there were lost. However a successful rear guard action was fought by the 1st Battalion Green Howards, which enabled a far greater proportion of the British forces to get away than anticipated. german troops advance towards trondheim
