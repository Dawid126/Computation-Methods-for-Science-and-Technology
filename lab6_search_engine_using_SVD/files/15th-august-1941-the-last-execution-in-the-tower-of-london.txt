The unfortunate Josef Jakobs had parachuted into Britain on the night of 31st January/1st February. He broke his ankle as he exited the plane and then broke his leg as he landed. He landed in the middle of fields and used his revolver to attract attention – whereupon he was discovered with his radio, maps, a large quantity of cash and a torn up code book and promptly arrested.After a limited recovery he was put on trial at the beginning of August. The charge was quite simple:Although Jakobs argued that he had always intended to give himself up the verdict could hardly have been in doubt. The historic final death warrant was passed to the Constable of the Tower:Most spies and traitors were hanged at Wandsworth Prison during the war. Jakobs was executed by Firing Squad at the Tower was made because he was a member of the German military. He was blindfolded and placed in a chair for the execution – the conventional method of execution used at the Tower during the 1914-18 war. The officer in charge gave a silent signal to the Firing Squad and he was shot dead.For more details see National Archives, Security Service file KV2/27 folio 29a“Committing treachery in that you at Ramsey in Huntingdonshire on the night of 31 January 1941/1 February 1941 descended by parachute with intent to help the enemy.”
