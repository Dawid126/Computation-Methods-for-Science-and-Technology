Convoy OG 74 left Liverpool on 12th September bound for Gibraltar. Its route took it way out into the Atlantic in the hope of avoiding German spotter planes and U Boats. Somewhat unusually, if this didn’t work there was a ‘rescue ship’ – the Walmer Castle – sailing with them.Late on September 20th the Walmer Castle was able to rescue fifty-eight men from the Empire Moat and Baltallinn after they had been torpedoed. Captain Clarke hoped to rejoin the convoy the next morning. The Walmer Castle proceeded on her zig-zag course at 12 knots, until suddenly, at 11.55 a.m., an enemy aircraft was seen directly ahead rapidly approaching from the west. Action stations was immediately sounded and fire was opened before the enemy was overhead. The aircraft swooped down, in a fore and aft line, over the Walmer Castle, but the captain put the helm hard over, and the first bomb fell into the sea. Three more attacks followed when the ship was machine gunned and bombed. On the third attack Clarke was shot in the stomach but remained at his post. He was killed when a bomb hit the bridge on the fourth run of the Focke Wolfe:The chief officer, Mr. A. Lawson had to take over, and he was later to report on the subsequent events: The corvette HMS Marigold later took off the remaining thirteen survivors, and the white hot hulk that had been the Walmer Castle was sunk by gunfire.This report originally appeared on Union-Castle.Net – currently offline.Details of Convoy OG 74 come courtesy of Warsailors.The chief engineer escaped from engine room with severe burns and died later. Third engineer, on duty below, lost. Many survivors in fore ´tween decks killed by gunfire and blast; ladders, hatches and accommodation reduced to matchwood. Remaining survivors and wounded were got on deck and placed on rafts and no.3 lifeboat. Motorboat blown away, no.2 port lifeboat badly holed and foundered. Fire raging throughout midships accommodation and on boat deck, effectively isolating fore end of ship from aft soon after bomb explosion. Bridge searched for survivors, and accommodation above and below decks, as far as possible, fire having taken firm hold of port side and accommodation on starboard completely wrecked. No.4 port boat badly holed and awash on launching. Injured and some survivors taken away. Two remaining rafts reserved for injured. A. Davies, Bos´un, and J. Piccilliro, 2nd stewd Barrett, R.N. Gunner, together with 3rd officer, Mr. T.A. Morris, did excellent work getting injured men on to these rafts. These cast off, with men in charge, as ship´s plating was blistering with heat. Thirteen men remained including two badly injured and one aged man. I felt the wisest course in these circumstances was to remain on board as long as possible, having in mind also, that only one buoyancy float remained. This we did, commending ourselves to God and wetting down the poop deck from time to time to prevent it firing.Convoy number OG 074 LIVERPOOL 12/09/41ALHAMA 032 Br 1,352 38
