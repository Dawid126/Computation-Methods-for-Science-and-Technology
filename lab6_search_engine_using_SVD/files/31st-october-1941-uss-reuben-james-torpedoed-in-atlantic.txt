The USS Reuben James was one of 24 US Navy destroyers assisting with the escort of convoys in the western North Atlantic, between America and Iceland. There had been a [permalink id=14168 text=”growing number of incidents”] between US ships and  U-Boats. Now the USS Reuben James became the first United States warship to be sunk as a result of hostile action in World War II. As dawn broke on the 31st she was torpedoed by U-552 commanded by Erich Topp, who was to become the third most successful U Boat captain of the war. One of only 44 survivors out of the 159 man crew, Chief Petty Officer William Burgstresser, was later to tell the St Petersburg Times:It was yet another provocation, but the United States was still not ready to go to war with Germany.The men who were lost on the Reuben James are remembered to this day. In 2017 I was contacted by Mike Perry and I am honoured to be able to add this postscript to these events:I was on watch in the engine room at 5:30 a.m. when we felt the impact. There were two explosions — one sounded like the magazine. Altogether there were eight men in both sections of the engine room.The lights went out and the steam flow was interrupted. There was a sinking motion of the ship as if she were going down by the bow.I went topside and found the whole forward part of the ship, including the bridge, completely demolished  and  carried  away. 31st october 1941 uss reuben james torpedoed in atlantic
