The accounts of when Hitler was informed about the invasion vary slightly about the exact time, yet all agree that he was not woken early. This is the account of Albert Speer, his Armaments Minister:See Inside the Third Reich.For a full illustrated story of D-Day and the Normandy campaign explore hundreds of contemporary images in the iPad App Overlord. The free iBook US Forces on D-Day provides a sample.On June 6, I was at the Berghof about ten o’clock in the morning when one of Hitler’s military adjutants told me that the invasion had begun early that morning.“Has the Fuehrer been awakened?” I asked.He shook his head. “No, he receives the news after he has eaten breakfast.”In recent days Hitler had kept on saying that the enemy would probably begin with a feigned attack in order to draw our troops away from the ultimate invasion site. So no one wanted to awaken Hitler and be ranted at for having judged the situation wrongly.At the situation conference in the Berghof salon a few hours later Hitler seemed more set than ever on his preconceived idea that the enemy was only trying to mislead him. “Do you recall? Among the many reports we’ve received there was one that exactly predicted the landing site and the day and hour. That only confirms my opinion that this is not the real invasion yet.” 6 june 1944 0945 hitler has not yet been told
