In 1943 the U.S. Armyâ€™s Signal Intelligence Service, the precursor to the National Security Agency made an attempt at decoding Soviet Diplomatic messages. A highly secret operation, later code named VENONA, was soon launched and but it was not until the post war 1940s that they were able to decrypt Soviet espionage messages that had been recorded but not decoded years earlier. It was suddenly revealed that Soviet Agents, amongst many other activities of interest to the United States, had been operating in Britain since the early part of the war:[i] JOHN: unidentified Moscow based spymaster
[ii] SAUSAGE-DEALERS: the Germans
[iii] FRIENDS: members of Communist Party of Great Britain
[iv] DICK: unidentified Soviet Agent based in LondonThe VENONA operation was eventually able to identify the Soviet  agents who had penetrated the MANHATTAN atom bomb program, including the Rosenbergs, but was not always able to identify known agents in sensitive positions. The operation continued until 1980 as efforts continued to identity the various individuals involved. The National Security Agency began releasing the documents to the public in 1995.From: LONDONTo: MOSCOWNo.91320th Aug. 40To JOHN1. On 18th August I was in MORDEN in south east LONDON.
