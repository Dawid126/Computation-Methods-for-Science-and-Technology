On 3rd June Roosevelt had written to Stalin to explain that the proposed ‘Second Front’, the invasion of western Europe would not take place until 1944. Stalin was naturally not very impressed by this decision. On the 11th June he replied, expressing his dismay that he he had not been consulted. Yet despite invitations to meet Roosevelt and Churchill, Stalin had refused to leave Soviet Russia for  a meeting with Churchill and Roosevelt. It is likely that he had a paranoid fear of what might happen if he left the USSR, but he was going to need to overcome that if he wanted to meet the other Aliied leaders together:Contemporary newsreel of the fight in Russia:Full length film “The Battle of Russia” from the US “Why we fight” series, shown to recruits in the US armed forces:…the opening of a second front in Europe, previously postponed from 1942 till 1943, is now being put off again, this time till the spring of 1944. Your decision creates exceptional difficulties for the Soviet Union, which, straining all its resources, for the past two years, has been engaged against the main forces of Germany and her satellites, and leaves the Soviet Army, which is fighting not only for its country, but also for its Allies, to do the job alone, almost single-handed, against an enemy that is still very strong and formidable. Need I speak of the disheartening negative impression that this fresh postponement of the second front and the withholding from our Army, which has sacrificed so much, of the anticipated substantial support by the Anglo-American armies, will produce in the Soviet Union—both among the people and in the Army? As for the Soviet Government, it cannot align itself with this decision, which, moreover, was adopted without its participation and without any attempt at a joint discussion of this highly important matter and which may gravely affect the subsequent course of the war. 11th june 1943 stalin objects to putting off invasion of europe
