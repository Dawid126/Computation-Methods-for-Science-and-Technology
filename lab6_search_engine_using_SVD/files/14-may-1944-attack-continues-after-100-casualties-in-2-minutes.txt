In Italy the battle for Cassino continued with the intensity that it had begun. There were several natural defensive features that had to be overcome, the river crossings that had begun on the 11th May had not proceeded as expected. Although strong swimmers had been able to cross the notorious River Rapido, they had been able to make little progress when they reached the opposite bank, held up by sustained machine gun fire.Tank support was brought in on the 13th and they were able to cross by a bridge, enabling the Hampshire Regiment to make some progress, although they did so in the face of grenades and machine gun fire. Captain Wakeford contributed to the capture of 200 prisoners that day. In attempting another tank supported crossing, of the River Pioppeta, on the 14th, the tanks crashed through the collapsing bridge. The Hampshires sustained over 100 casualties in two minutes, as the surprise of their attack was lost. It took extraordinary courage to pursue the attack in these circumstances.
