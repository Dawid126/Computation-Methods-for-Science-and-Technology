The aircraft carrier HMS Courageous was on anti submarine patrol south of Ireland. She had despatched 4 Swordfish aircraft to aid another ship under attack by U Boat. She herself was then discovered and tracked by U-29. When she turned into the wind to allow her aircraft to land, she also moved into a position from where she could be torpedoed. At 19.50 U-29 fired three torpedoes and scored two hits on the port side. HMS Courageous sank within 17 minutes with the loss of 518 officers and men out of a total crew of 1259.  Captain Makeig-Jones was last seen saluting the ensign as his ship sank.British Movietone News released on 21st September 1939.There are several good images of HMS Courageous at Maritime Quest.. hms courageous torpedoed
