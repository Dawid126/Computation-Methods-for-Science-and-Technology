General Bluemntritt locates the first real difficulties for the German army appearing between the battle of Vyasma, which fell on the 14th, and the fall of Bryansk on the 20th October. Huge numbers of Soviet prisoners again became encircled during these battles, perhaps as many as 660,000. But there were now signs that the Wehrmacht could not continue to make the progress it was accustomed to:There was another “equally unpleasant surprise” at the same time – the appearance of the Russian T-34 tank:General Blumentritt’s post war account of the Barbarossa campaign appeared in The Fatal Decisions.The open country too, become a sticky morass. The infantryman slithers in the mud, while many teams of horses are needed, to drag each gun forward. All wheeled vehicles sink up to their axles in the slime. Even tractors can only move with great difficulty. A large proportion of our heavy artillery was soon stuck fast and was therefore unavailable for the Moscow battle. The quality of the mud may be understood when it is realized that even tanks and other tracked vehicles could only just get along and were frequently and repeatedly mired. The strain that all this caused our already exhausted troops can perhaps be imagined.at that time our infantry was equipped only with 37 mm. and 50 mm. anti-tank guns.
