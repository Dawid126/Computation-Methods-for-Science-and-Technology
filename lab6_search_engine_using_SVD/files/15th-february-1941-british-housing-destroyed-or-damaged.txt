Seventy-five people were killed and 145 seriously injured.Saturday, 15th Heard the news of Thursday night’s damage today in the Mercury. I could not understand why one bomb should cause such a considerable amount of damage. A lady explained to me that her son was on Hendon aerodrome with two W.R.A.F.s, and they saw the thing come down. It is a new kind of bomb. Had a flare attached to it. It fell on High St. before the Warning. People were out and so did not stand a chance. It destroyed five streets of houses and spread damage for three miles – so the lady said. Many killed and injured and made homeless. It was a working class district of Hendon. The three young people on the roof found themselves tied in knots, and did not know if they were dead or alive.
