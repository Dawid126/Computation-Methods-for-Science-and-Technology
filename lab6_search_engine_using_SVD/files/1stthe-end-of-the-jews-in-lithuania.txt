One of the most comprehensive of the Nazi written records of the Holocaust that survived was written on 1st December 1941, now known as the ‘Jager Report’. SS-Standartenfuhrer Jager completed a “final return” for his unit of the Einsatzgruppen, which had been operating in Lithuania. It is just a simple list – a list that reduces mass murder to a matter of accounting. Over six pages Jager gave the date, the location and separate numbers for the men, women and children killed that day, plus the total for the day.Almost all of the victims were Jewish but Jager was precise in including the small numbers of Communists, Partisans and Prisoners of War that were also executed as a matter of course by his unit. He also included the killings by Lithuanian militia groups that had been encouraged by his unit, amongst them the particularly horrific [permalink id=12236 text=”Lietukis Garage massacre”].For Jager all of this could be reduced to a matter of statistics, as the final page of his report shows:The original report and transcription can be found at the Holocaust Research Project.Total carried forward	99,80412.9.41	 City of Wilna	 993 Jews, 1,670 Jewesses, 771 Jewish children	 3,334

In Lithuania there are no more Jews, apart from Jewish workers and their families. . . .The distance between from the assembly point to the graves was on average 4 to 5 Km. . . . I consider the Jewish action more or less terminated as far as Einsatzkommando 3 is concerned. Those working Jews and Jewesses still available are needed urgently and I can envisage that after the winter this workforce will be required even more urgently. I am of the view that the sterilization program of the male worker Jews should be started immediately so that reproduction is prevented. If despite sterilization a Jewess becomes pregnant she will be liquidated. . . . (signed)
