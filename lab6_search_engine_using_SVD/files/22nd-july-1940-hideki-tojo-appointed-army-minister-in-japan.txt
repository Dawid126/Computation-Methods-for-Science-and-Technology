Although Tojo did not become Prime Minister until October 1941, his appointment as Army Minister was significant. His influence in the Cabinet took the Japanese in a new direction. His political appointment effectively marked the end of the argument from those within the Japanese establishment who wanted a withdrawal from China. General Tojo was a strong supporter of the Tripartite Alliance between Germany, Italy and Japan and his militaristic and aggressive outlook hardened the Japanese position towards a wider war. The U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull was later to describe him as:â€¦ a typical Japanese officer, with a small-bore, straight-laced, one-track mind. He was stubborn and self-willed, rather stupid, hard-working, and possessed a quantity of drive. 22nd july 1940 hideki tojo appointed army minister in japan
