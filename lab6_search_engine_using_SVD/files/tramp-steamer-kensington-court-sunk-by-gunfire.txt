At 12.38 hours on 18 Sep, 1939, the unescorted Kensington Court (Master Joseph Schofield) was stopped by U-32 with 13 shots of gunfire about 120 miles west of Lands End. The ship was sunk by a coup de gr√¢ce at 14.00 hours. The master and 34 crew members were rescued by a Sunderland aircraft (228 Sqdn RAF, pilot F/Lt Thurston M.W. Smith) and the Sunderland L5802 (204 Sqdn RAF/E, pilot F/Lt John Barrett). On 2 November, each pilot was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for their feat.Details courtesy uboat.net tramp steamer kensington court sunk by gunfire
