While the fires were still burning in Hannover and Bremen from the RAF night time raids, the German air defences had to be ready for the USAAF attacking by day. The tempo of operations was steadily being increased and this week was to see a series of big raids by the 8th Air Force, and corresponding losses.On the 9th October the principal target was Marienburg in eastern Germany, where Focke-Wulf production had been relocated, having previously been sited at Bremen. It was thought that it was now out of range of the bombers – but the USAAF were to prove that to be a mistake. Three other ‘diversionary’ but still very significant raids took place at the same time, also to targets in eastern Germany and Poland. This was the Mission report of the Group that went to Anklam:More info on this mission at the 303BG websiteThe Marienburg Raid was featured in the 1944 documentary Target for Today, which is a comprehensive overview of the work of the Eighth Air Force in the bomber war against Germany. This movie was previously available on YouTube. The raids begins at 1:00 on the video, with footage of the B-17 gun crews in action on the approach to Anklam.303BG Mission Report – Target: Aircraft Component Plant, Anklam, Germany.

The 303rd BG(H) led eight combat wings to the target, flying at a relatively low altitude of 13,000 feet.The conditions at the target were perfect for an attack. There was no flak and no fighters were encountered in the target area. The weather was superb with no clouds and unlimited visibility. Bomb results were clearly visible and results were excellent. The lead bombardier, 1Lt. Byron K. Butt reported, “A damn well-planned, well-executed mission by all concerned.” The 303rd BG(H) dropped 27 tons of 1,000-lb. bombs and incendiaries.After bombing and leaving the target, the first flak was encountered at Rostock. It was intense and accurate. From the target to Rostock, enemy fighter attacks were spasmodic. They then became persistent until about 100 miles from the Kiel Peninsula. Gen. Travis reported 169 ME-110s and FW-190s, and some ME-210s and JU-88s in this area. The P-47 fighters that were supposed to meet the bombers failed to make their rendezvous.Aircraft #42-5221 was seen to be hit by 20mm cannon fire from a formation of three FW-190s flying abreast. The approximate position was at the Danish coast. It was last seen at 8,000 feet, with its No. 3 engine on fire and feathered. It crashed in the Baltic Sea south of Lolland, Denmark. 9th october 1943 the marienburg focke wulf plant raid
