Rommel’s surprise assault on the British lines, launched on 21st January, ran out off steam on the 7th February. The British had managed to develop a series of defensive positions in the desert, known as ‘boxes’.There was now a standoff at the Gazala line and a period of static warfare developed.From the Military Situation Report for the week, as reported to the British War Cabinet, see TNA CAB 66/22/4Libya.Since the forward troops of the 8th Army occupied their present line, which runs southwards from Gazala, no major operations have taken place. Our fighting patrols and our mobile columns have been most active against the enemy in the Tmimi area and about Mekili.The enemy is apparently trying to establish a series of strong points extending for some 17 miles southwards from the coastal road between Gazala and Tmimi. His object appears to be to prevent observation of his movements west of that line. No doubt General Rommel is concentrating upon the re-disposition of his forces and the development of his lines of communication, which must by now be extended to their limit. 7th february 1942 rommels advance stops at gazala line
