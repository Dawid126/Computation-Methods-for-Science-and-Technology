Trench Shelters were a relatively economical and quickly produced means of providing Air Raid shelters for large numbers of people. Unfortunately the ‘ladder design’ of intercommunicating trenches meant they were very vulnerable to bombs landing nearby, which could cause whole trenches to collapse, instantly burying their occupants. On the evening of 15th October a bomb fell on the Trench Shelter in Kennington Park, Lambeth, south London. The district Air Raid Precautions log for that evening and the following day gives some indication of the difficulties faced by the authorities in dealing with the disaster, even as more bombs fell into the Park:No records were kept of the numbers entering large public shelters such as these, it would have hardly have been practicable to do so. But when disaster struck it was impossible to know how many casualties the authorities were dealing with. Many of the bodies in Kennington Park were blown apart and most were buried. Eventually 48 bodies out of the estimated 104 fatalities were recovered. The balance remain under the grass of Kennington Park to this day.See Kennington’s Forgotten Tragedy.Tuesday 15th October 1940…20.05 Express report – casualties at Kennington Park trenches.20.16 Please send medical aid for casualties in Kennington Park surface shelter.20.20 Send doctor to Kennington Park trenches.
