See The Ciano Diaries 1939-1943: The Complete, Unabridged Diaries of Count Galeazzo Ciano, Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, 1936-1943July 22, 1941Dummy air raids continue at Rome. It was the Duce who personally ordered an air raid in the capital every time there is one in Naples.He does this because he wants to give the country the impression that a war is taking place. He has also ordered that at the first opportunity anti-aircraft guns should fire in order to make it more exciting.Is all this worthwhile? If we listen to comments on the street, I should say not at all.There is more insistent news about the coming English offensive in Libya.  22nd july 1941 mussolini plays at war
