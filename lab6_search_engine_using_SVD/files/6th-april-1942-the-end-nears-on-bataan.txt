On the Bataan peninsula on the Phillipines the inevitable end was drawing near. There was no prospect of relief coming from the USA yet the fighting became ever more desperate.Philip Buencamino was keeping a diary whilst serving in the Philippine Army HQ:Diary of Philip Buencamino III: From the Philippine Diary ProjectHQ, BATAANMore men retreating, more stragglers, the rear area has become the front. Japs keep on following their gains, bombing, shelling, blasting, burning, shooting, bayoneting. They have been waiting for this hour. Blood is flowing freely…Evacuee area is a most pitiful sight. Saw women and children gathered around the cinders of their former dwellings, begging for food, bewildered by the terrific advance of the Japanese.From morning to sunset, the hillsides and shell-burnt roads have been brown with bleeding men -the remnants of the Filipino-American forces. These are the men who have electrified the world with their glorious stand.Saw troops of the 41st lying on the ground near Mariveles. Most of them were thin, emaciated, yellow with malaria. Many were dying. Others were blind to due to vitamin deficiencies. Some did not have even strength to drive the flies crawling on their bodies. When planes hovered above, they did not move, they did not care to move. Death would be a welcome respite.Japs advancing fiercely, killing mercilessly, bayoneting with unleashed fury.Already the flies, the hawks and the pariah dogs have found the dying &amp; dead. Saw a big rat bite off a dead man’s eye.Still no order to surrender. Fight must continue. Bleeding must continue. Dying must continue. Can hear roar of machine-guns. More &amp; more boys dying, by the minute.(later)Received a phone-call from Manny de Leon from Corregidor. He said “Leonie is very ill.” I gave him my regards and farewell. I told him the lines had broken. After that our telephone went dead. 6th april 1942 the end nears on bataan
