From the Home Security Situation Report for the week , TNA CAB 66/16/10.Also on this day the Norwegian ship D/S Profit, on loan to the British merchant marine, was lost four hours out of Southend, apparently in Barrow Deep in the Thames Estuary, after it hit a mine en route to Hull … see the comments by Kathleen below, who survived the blitz but lost her father on this night. Kathleen has been told that her father Edward McGee, an Irishman serving with the Queens Own Regiment on a Anti Aircraft gun on a Defensively Equipped Merchant Ship, died when the D/S Profit was sunk. Records suggest that there was only one British soldier lost with the D/S Profit … but it would take more than one man to crew an AA gun.More information on the DS Profit can be found on Warsailors, which suggests that the British casualty on the D/S Profit was Arthur BeeneyOn the [16th/17th] one of the heaviest attacks was made on London since the war began. Bombing commenced shortly after 2100 and lasted until nearly dawn.Some sixty-six boroughs were affected, the main bombing being on central and southern London. Damage in the docks area was comparatively light and so far there is little damage to key points to record. In addition to H.E. and incendiary bombs a large number of parachute mines were dropped and great damage was done to private property by fire and blast.Among the public buildings damaged were St. Pauls Cathedral, the Houses of Parliament, the Admiralty, the Law Courts and the National Gallery. Many roads were blocked and the railway systems were hit in nineteen places. There were a large number of fires, the most serious being at L.N.E.R Goods Yard in Lisson Grove. Other serious fires were caused at Selfridges, Bessborough Gardens, Westminster, and the Kidbrooke R.A.F. Stores Depot. Although many fires were burning at daybreak, the situation was considered to be in hand. 17th april 1941 heavy attack on london
