See fascinating analysis of British World War II posters at The Weapon on the Wall by Paul Vyšný at St Andrews University.In the finest tradition of the British civil service they produced the infamous “red poster” of 1939 – ‘Your courage, your cheerfulness, your resolution, will bring us victory’.

It was one of a series of three posters issued by the Ministry shortly after the outbreak of war in September 1939.
