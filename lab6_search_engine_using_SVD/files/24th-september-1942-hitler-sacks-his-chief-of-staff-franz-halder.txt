The [permalink id=22689 text=”deteriorating relationship”] between Hitler and his Generals came to a culmination on the 24th September when he sacked his Chief of Staff, Franz Halder. The reality that the objective for 1942, the oilfields of Russia, was not going to be achieved, was sinking in. Deep down their must have been a realisation that the war was looking increasingly unwinnable. The Soviet state had not collapsed when they ‘kicked in the door’ in 1941 and their was every sign that the Russian resistance had been stiffening throughout 1942.Hitler’s belief that an ‘unconquerable will’ would be sufficient to ensure a German victory was increasingly at odds with the military facts. As a professional soldier Franz Halder was the man who was responsible for presenting Hitler with these unpalatable facts.Halder’s diary was largely confined to military matters and he only made limited comment on his relationship with Hitler:Only recently Halder had recorded the statistics for casualties since the launch of Operation Barbarossa in June 1941.It was bad enough, but it was just the beginning.Halder was to finish the war in a concentration camp after being suspected of involvement in the July 1944 bomb plot.The Halder Diaries can be found online.24th September 1942After situation conference, farewell by the Fuehrer: My nerves are worn out, also his nerves are no longer fresh.
