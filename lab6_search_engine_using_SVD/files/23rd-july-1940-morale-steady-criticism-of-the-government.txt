The Ministry of Information compiled daily reports on the state of morale in the country, paying particular attention the reaction of the man in the street to events in the war.On the 22nd the Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, had broadcast a high profile address in which he had dismissed HItler’s “peace offer” of 19th July. At one stage Lord Halifax had been considered  the front runner to succeed Chamberlain as Prime Minister. It is evident that he could not possibly have had raised morale in the way that Winston Churchill so notably achieved during this period:TNA INF 1 /274Morale is high. People are fully behind the war effort although small pockets of defeatism confined to certain localities, age groups or social groups are still present.The last week has been one of public criticism however and the stock of the Government has fallen. The various causes of this criticism have already been noted:Prosecutions and heavy sentences for defeatist talk
Capitulation over the Burma Road
Confusion over certain Government instructions, e.g. Stay Put, Siren policy.
The press campaign against the internment of aliens.
Tea rationing (among the working classes)
Silent Column campaign
