For a long time Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, had been led to believe that he would be in command of Overlord. As a professional soldier it was a deeply held aspiration to lead the Allied forces back into France, from where he had been evacuated in 1940. Eventually, as the US participation in Allied operations grew, Churchill had to tell him, in 1943, that it had become inevitable that an American commander would be appointed. He had nevertheless remained closely involved in the central Allied decision making.His diary for the 5th June was not particularly optimistic:See Alanbrooke War Diaries 1939-1945: Field Marshal Lord AlanbrookeGet a full illustrated history of D-Day and the Normandy campaign, explore hundreds of contemporary images in the iPad App Overlord.
