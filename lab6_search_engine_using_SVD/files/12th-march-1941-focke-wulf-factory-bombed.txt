Following [permalink id=10535 text=”Churchill’s directive”] giving top priority to the Battle of the Atlantic, Bomber Command switched attention to targets that furthered this cause. These included the aircraft factory producing the [permalink id=7020 text=”Condor aircraft”] that were proving such a menace to merchant shipping:From the Air Situation Report for the week see TNA CAB 66/15/31The reduction in the scale of our night bombing is accounted for by the unsuitable weather conditions which prevailed during most of the week. Full advantage, however, was taken of the improvement which occurred on the night of the 12th/13th March, and 258 bombers were despatched, including Stirling, Halifax and Manchester aircraft. The main targets were in Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg.A feature of the attack on Berlin was the number of large size bombs which were dropped; these included 10 of 1,900 lbs. and 7 of 1,000 lbs. Most bombs fell in the target area, causing a great many fires. At Bremen, the Focke Wulf airframe factory was heavily attacked, and a long building burst into flames; a hit with a 1,000-lb. bomb was registered in the middle of this target and a terrific explosion ensued. Good fires were also reported to be burning in the industrial area of the town.Nearly seventy other aircraft concentrated their attack on the Blohm and Voss shipbuilding yards at Hamburg, where large fires were started, and a smaller number bombed the industrial areas. During these raids our aircraft were subjected to intense A.A. fire and searchlight dazzle. 12th march 1941 focke wulf factory bombed
