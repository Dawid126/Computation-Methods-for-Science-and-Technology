The weekly Naval Military and Air Situation reports were a comprehensive overview of the war for the benefit of the War Cabinet, Commonwealth governments and senior civil servants and military commanders. They tried to encompass every aspect of the war – the air war over Libya merited just one paragraph out of seventy seven this week:From the Air Situation Report for the week as reported to the British War Cabinet, see TNA CAB 66/18/41For each and everyone of these attacks there were personal stories attached and the direction of people’s lives were radically changed. Iain M. MacDonald was just one of them:Read more of his story at the Scottish Saltire Aircrew AssociationOne night attack was made by 15 Wellingtons on Benghazi, and hits were made on military stores. A heavier raid was carried out against Barce, where the targets bombed included the railway sidings, workshops, barracks and the aerodrome. A series of attacks was made on enemy aerodromes in Libya. At Derna six enemy aircraft were probably destroyed on the ground, and at Capuzzo one large aircraft was destroyed and a big fire was started at the petrol dump. By day seven Marylands, escorted by fighters, successfully bombed stores and dumps near Gambut, and another attack by nine Marylands was made on heavy guns east of Tobruk.I bailed out of my badly damaged Wellington aircraft over Benghazi at 1 a.m. on the morning of 7th September 1941. A band of wandering Arabs whom befriended us, unfortunately turned out to value the bounty offered by the enemy more than our friendship, turned us over to the Italian/German forces; not before making off with our parachutes, and anything else they could lay their hands on. Thus started a long series of solitary confinement, interrogation, prison camps, travel in cattle trucks and hardship which was to last over three years and seven months.
