The note handed to the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop by British Ambassador Sir Nevile Henderson at 9.30pm:For all related documents see the Avalon ProjectOn the instructions of His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, I have the honour to make the following communication:-Early this morning the German Chancellor issued a proclamation to the German army which indicated clearly that he was about to attack Poland.Information which has reached His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the French Government indicates that German troops have crossed the Polish frontier and that attacks upon Polish towns are proceeding.In these circumstances, it appears to the Governments of the United Kingdom and France that by their action the German Government have created conditions (viz., an aggressive act of force against Poland threatening the independence of Poland) which call for the implementation by the Governments of the United Kingdom and France of the undertaking to Poland to come to her assistance.I am accordingly to inform your Excellency that unless the German Government are prepared to give His Majesty’s Government satisfactory assurances that the German Government have suspended all aggressive action against Poland and are prepared promptly to withdraw their forces from Polish territory, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom will without hesitation fulfil their obligations to Poland.  the british ultimatum to germany
