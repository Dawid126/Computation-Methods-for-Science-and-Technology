One of their first actions had been to deliberately bomb the city’s centralised food warehouses – cutting the food supplies for the city at a stroke. What limited food that remained was strictly rationed – at about a third of normal daily nutritional requirements. Rations were cut again during November. Alternative supplies of food had rapidly been used up, pets had disappeared, the zoo animals were killed, the burnout remains of the warehouses dug up and sifted through. People everywhere were weakened by hunger and now, as the really cold weather arrived, the death toll began to rise dramatically.
