The first German bomber brought down on Britain
Thought to have been on a reconnaissance flight and brought down by RAF fighters, out of the crew of four, two were killed and one wounded.Such crashes were bound to attract the public and made good propaganda value. Downed enemy planes were often left in place for a while, and then transported through town centres when removed. Crashed RAF planes were removed rather more swiftly and discreetly. first german aircraft brought down on british soil
