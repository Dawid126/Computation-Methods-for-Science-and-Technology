Huge numbers of prisoners were being taken by the Germans in the encirclement battles where whole armies were captured. The Wehrmacht was totally unprepared to handle them all and a very high proportion of those captured in the early battles would die by the end of the year – from starvation, sickness, maltreatment, exhaustion from the long marches, and exposure to the elements. For some the end was a much swifter – perhaps, with hindsight, mercifully swift.
