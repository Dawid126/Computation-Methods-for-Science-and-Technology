One of the critical factors in winning the Battle of the Atlantic was the ever increasing use of airborne surveillance to hunt for U-Boats. This meant long tiring hours for the crews as they ceaselessly searched the sea below or monitored the radar. Very few patrols resulted in a sighting of a U-boat, much less a successful attack. Yet the crews had to be ready to go into action in an instant and deliver their depth charges before a U-boat could submerge.The need to patrol a massive sea area meant that RAF Coastal Command stations were often located in some very remote locations on the east side of the Atlantic, including west Africa. Their Canadian and U.S. counterparts were based in similar locations on the west side. In May 1943 an Air Ministry photographer was sent to one of the remotest islands in Britain, Benbecula, to document the work of these men:Interesting compilation of contemporary film of Coastal Command aircraft and U-Boats with contemporary music  26th may 1943 a remote outpost of raf coastal command
