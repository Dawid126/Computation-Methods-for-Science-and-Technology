Although the Battle of Britain was later officially deemed to have concluded by this point Fighter Command were still very busy dealing with day time raiders over Britain, as can seen from the Air Situation for the week ending 5th December 1940:See TNA CAB/66/14/3Great Britain.[During the week] Fighter Command flew 626 patrols, involving 2,543 sorties, by day, and 78 sorties by night. These figures show a slight reduction by day and a considerable one by night, weather conditions having been unsuitable for night interceptions on four of the nights during the period under review.The increased enemy activity by day has not resulted in any serious attacks, most of the aircraft employed having been fighters, or fighter-bombers, which confined their operations to sweeps at high altitudes over the south-eastern and southern counties; on three days a few isolated aircraft penetrated the London area. Towards the end of the week the weather became unsuitable for day operations and there was no activity except from reconnaissance aircraft.Our fighters had a successful day on the 29th November, when they shot down four bombers without loss; three of these were attacking the disabled destroyer H.M.S. Javelin off the Lizard, and the fourth was spotting for the long-range Channel guns. During the week twenty-five enemy aircraft were destroyed by our fighters in daylight operations, with the loss of eighteen aircraft and eight pilots. 3rd december 1940 fighter command still active by day
