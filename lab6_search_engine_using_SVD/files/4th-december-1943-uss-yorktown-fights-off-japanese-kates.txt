After the successful assaults on the Marshall and the Gilbert Islands – including the bloody battles at Tarawa – many of the escorting ships returned to the U.S. Pacific base at Pearl harbour. En route, on 4th December, the planes from the carriers made attacks on the Japanese occupied Kwajalein Atoll and Wotje Atoll. Later in the day they came under attack from Japanese planes. A fairly routine day of operations for the U.S. Pacific Fleet at the time.The 4th December is probably most notable for the dramatic photograph taken just after one of the Japanese attackers was hit:It was a busy day for the Task Group as this report from the War Diary of the U.S.S.
