From the Patrol Report of Lieutenant-Commander Edward Bickford, on HM Submarine Salmon:The U-boat was U-36, commanded by KrvKpt. Wilhelm Fröhlich on his second patrol.See TNA  ADM199/1839Nothing of interest occurred until December 4th, when I was on patrol in my area and at 1330 a U-boat  was sighted in position 57° North 5°10′ East by my First Lieutenant. Its conning tower appeared like a box floating in the water, but he had noticed that it did not go ‘up and down’ with the waves and had come to a shallow depth for further investigation. Simultaneously the Asdic office reported a hydrophone effect on the same bearing.On going to the periscope I found the U-boat to be steering approximately 350 degrees, evidently on passage outward bound. I was a long way off track and closed her at full speed and eventually fired at 5,000 yards on 110 degrees track, the salvo being spread at seven-second intervals, torpedoes being set at eight feet.At least one torpedo broke surface and much disturbance was visible on the surface on firing. I lost trim temporarily but regained it in time to be at periscope depth before my shot could have taken effect. I saw her through the periscope blown to small fragments which rose at least 200 feet into the air.I surfaced to pick up survivors but found nothing but oil, wreckage, one dead body and a lifebelt. Bubbles continued to come up from the bottom for some time. Many volunteered to swim out through the oil to retrieve the life belt as a memento. I considered this unnecessary and, fearing aircraft and the possible presence of another U-boat, I dived once clear of the oil patch. The U-boat had one gun and was therefore of the sea-going or ocean-going class. It is impossible to tell the difference between these types except at close range … hms salmon sinks a u boat in the north sea
