It was the first where, outside London, there was widespread damage caused by a firestorm conflagration. Yet other cities would suffer comparable, if not worse damage. During the Southampton Blitz the city suffered similar casualties to Coventry but over a much longer period of time.The 23rd of September was not the first time that Southampton had been bombed but it was the first major raid. It would not be the last.  There was another huge raid on the 30th November which would bring such widespread devastation that there was no water to fight the fires, which burned out of control. German bomber pilots returning to hit the city again on the night of the 31st could see the flames as they crossed the French coast. There were over 1500 air raid alarms and 57 significant bombing raids on Southampton during the war.Stella Green was eight  years old at the time of the November 1940 raid:Read  Stella Green’s full account on BBC People’s War.A short documentary about the Blitz on Southampton during the Second World War, 20th June 1940 – 15th July 1944 is available on Vimeo..Our house was on a hill overlooking Southampton.

We were put to bed in the bunk beds. You could see the whole of the city of Southampton from the hill and if there was a raid it looked like dozens of vast red fans over Southampton. I found that very frightening and I was glad to be in the shelter. If in the day time there was raid and we hadn’t time to get to the shelter, my mother used to push us under the stairs. 23th november 1940 first night of southampton blitz
