The Germans moved swiftly to consolidate their hold over Norway. They were much better equipped than their Norwegian opponents. The bulk of the Norwegian army was comprised of reservists with limited training. Norway had not fought a war for 125 years and most its weapons were obsolete. Crucially it had no anti-tank guns and few anti-aircraft guns. Even though the ranks of the Norwegian Army were quickly swelled by thousands of reservists rallying to the cause, many of whom were expert riflemen, they had lacked the firepower to confront the Germans. The Norwegians were forced to adopt a holding strategy while waiting for support from Britain and France. 14th april 1940 german troops consolidate in norway
