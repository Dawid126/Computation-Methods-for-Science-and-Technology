The work of Coastal Command was unusually hazardous with a high rate of losses throughout the war, its work often neglected by comparison with Bomber Command:From the Air Situation Report for the week, TNA CAB 66/16/15, which also records that Bomber Command was engaged against shipping during this period:On the 18th April, an aircraft on routine patrol sighted a convoy of eight merchant vessels off Stavanger; two formations of Blenheims from Coastal Command were sent out, in the morning and afternoon respectively, to attack this convoy. As a result of the first patrol a 7,000-ton vessel is believed to have been hit, and a 3,000-ton vessel was hit twice and seen to be rapidly sinking; two of our aircraft were lost. During the second patrol the Blenheims were attacked by five Me. 110, three of our aircraft being shot down, but all were able to drop their bombs and a direct hit is estimated on another ship.On each day of the week formations of aircraft have been sent out from Bomber Command to attack enemy shipping, with the following results :â€”
7,000-ton M.V. believed hit off Brest.
