It was a warm late summers Sunday morning in Britain when Neville Chamberlain addressed the nation on radio. Many people in Britain recorded their reactions to the declaration of war:Joan Wyndham, then 17, was among many who recorded the first air raid warning in London:See Joan Wyndham: Love Lessons: A Wartime Diary J. K. Stanford , a veteran of the First World war, had voluntarily rejoined the army in July as a junior officer:See: J. K. Stanford: TAIL OF AN ARMY.This morning war was declared by the Prime Minister over the radio.Five minutes after the National Anthem, while we were still sitting around feeling rather sick, the air-raid warning went.

The brim of his helmet caught its roof with a hollow clang, and he fell back as if pole-axed.We picked him up, dusted him down, and assured him he was the primal British casualty of the war. He drove off, shaken, to ‘reconnoitre’ an inn, where they were lenient to travellers on a Sunday morning. The war had begun. “ war is declared
