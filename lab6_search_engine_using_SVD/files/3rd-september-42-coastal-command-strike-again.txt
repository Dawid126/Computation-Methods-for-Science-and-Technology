These publicity shots were taken during August 1942 when Coastal Command sunk no U-Boats. The long patrols, lasting around 12 hours, were way out into the Atlantic and across the Bay of Biscay. Fortunes changed in September 1942 when improved intelligence and ever improving radar brought them three successful U-boat kills. The first was on 3rd September.The U-705 was caught entering the Bay of Biscay as she returned from her first war patrol which commenced on the 1st August. She had sunk one ship, the Ballardier, on the 15th August. The Ballardier was armed and had fired on U-705 when she spotted her at midnight on the 14th. Nearly four hours later U-705 torpedoed her, killing 13 men.All 45 of the crew of U-705, commanded by Karl-Horst Horn, died in this attack. 3rd september 42 coastal command strike again
