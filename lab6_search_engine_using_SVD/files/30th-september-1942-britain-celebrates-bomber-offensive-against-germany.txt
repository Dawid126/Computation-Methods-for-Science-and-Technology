The anniversary of three years of war presented the opportunity to review Britain’s progress. Yet on the face of it there was little to celebrate. Britain had been pushed out Europe, first in France then in Norway then in Greece. The ‘Second Front’ looked a long way off. The disasters of early 1942 in the Far East had been a humiliation for the British Empire. In the desert of North Africa it still looked very much as if British Forces were on the back foot. Whatever plans were afoot for the future there was little to celebrate. The Ministry of Information did the best it could.The one substantive area of progress were the operations of Bomber Command, the one area where Britain was hitting back, apparently effectively.The War Cabinet were presented with statistics on the growing power of Bomber Command during the weekly review ending on 30th September:From the Air Situation Report for the week as reported to the British War Cabinet, see TNA CAB 66/29/23For roughly the same number of sorties about 25% more bombs were being dropped.
