Having fought in Norway, the Balkans and Crete the paratrooper Martin Poppel was already a veteran. Now, in late December, he found himself on a slow train to the front where the great majority of the Germans would fight. It was a dreary journey across eastern Germany, Poland and Russia and the more they saw what was happening to their fellow soldiers the less there was to encourage then.

No real villages, only little settlements. Houses? No, only shabby huts made of wood, each one like all the rest. The whole thing makes a dreary and wretched impression on us.We stop for some time near Bialystock and change engines. …A transport train carrying wounded men stops nearby. It’s a wretched sight which makes it clear to us how bitterly this war is being fought. It consists of ordinary goods wagons with straw in them for the wounded to lie on.
