Incredibly there were still some civilian aircraft flights over Britain even as the Luftwaffe continued to mount daytime raids around the country. The de Havilland Dragon aircraft had just taken off from St Mary’s on the Isles of Scilly for the short 25 mile hop back to the mainland at Penzance when it was intercepted by a Heinkel III, apparently returning from a raid on the north of England. The forward guns easily dealt with the unarmed Dragon aircraft, which crashed into the sea with no survivors.See aviation-safety.net.Capt William Donald Anderson DFC killed.
