In London the Metropolitan Police went to great lengths to capture at least a summary of the damage done in each raid. The archive records for each Divisional police area, approximately equivalent to a London borough, contain page after page of records, with one or two pages for each day. The records for Plaistow for the 19th March 1941 are somewhat longer than usual, as this raid was the largest on London since the [permalink id=9653 text=”29th December 1940″], but is representative of the type of detail recorded. There is one unusual ‘feature’ – the death of Police Sergeant Murray, killed by blast in the Barking Road, on his way to an incident at the height of the raid.See TNA MEPO 8/108. 19th march 1941 one night in the london blitz
