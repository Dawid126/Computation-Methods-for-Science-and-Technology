He telegraphed Germany:The reply came later that day:MaritimeQuest has an excellent collection of images of the Admiral Graf Spee.1. Strategic position off Montevideo: Besides the cruisers and destroyers, Ark Royal and Renown. Close blockade at night. Escape into open sea and break-through to home waters hopeless.
