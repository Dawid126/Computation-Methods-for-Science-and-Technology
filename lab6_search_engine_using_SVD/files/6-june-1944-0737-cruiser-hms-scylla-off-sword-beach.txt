The free iBook US Forces on D-Day provides a sample.Quiet uneventful night until 0445 when we reached  our objective, marked by a midget submarine and commenced bombarding the shore with the Warspite, Ramilles, Mauritius, Danae, Lord Roberts and dozens of Destroyers.  The destroyers are steaming along nearer the beaches than we are ourselves.  During all this the barges have been coming up to the beaches. L.C.G.’s – Landing Craft Guns carrying 4.7′s have been bombarding along with us.  The noise down here in the Steering position sounds more to us like a stable full of restless horses.The airforce did a fine job this morning at 0400.  Apparently when we arrived at the beaches fires were burning fiercely ashore.It is now 0730 and so far we have heard nothing from jerry except a report of E Boats on our port side at 0645.  Perhaps it is due to our fighter umbrella which I believe are continuously up in strength of 9 squadrons and with Rocket Typhoons flying over should be a pretty formidable force to oppose jerry.0737 – German Aircraft have just been reported over the beaches and the mist has just risen over Ouistrame, our bombardment target on the mouth of the River Orne. We are now going to breakfast or rather our breakfasts are coming to us since we are on action messing. Curse it. 6 june 1944 0737 cruiser hms scylla off sword beach
